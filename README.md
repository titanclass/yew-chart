# Yew Charting Library

`yew-chart` is a collection of components that can be assembled to form charts
for the [Yew framework](https://github.com/yewstack/yew).

Here is a soil moisture/rainfall chart that has been produced using this library:

Here's another chart produced by this library, representing what is known as ["Delta-T"](http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/deltat.shtml):

<p align="center"><img src="./images/delta-t.png" alt="Delta-T chart" width="70%" /></p>

By leveraging these SVG-based components many types of charts can be formed
with a great deal of flexibility. The library is intended as a toolkit that
provides conveniences for rendering chart primitives. These primitives can
be regarded at a similar level as SVG's primitives i.e. lines, polygons etc.

## Example Plots

Two basic projects are given in the `examples` folder.

### Line Chart

`examples/basic` is configured to output a basic line chart:

...and here's the entire Yew component that was used to generate it:

```rust
const WIDTH: f32 = 533.0;
const HEIGHT: f32 = 300.0;
const MARGIN: f32 = 50.0;
const TICK_LENGTH: f32 = 10.0;

#[function_component(App)]
fn app() -> Html {
    let end_date = Utc::now();
    let start_date = end_date.sub(Duration::days(4));
    let timespan = start_date..end_date;

    let circle_text_labeller = Rc::from(series::circle_text_label("Label")) as Rc<dyn Labeller>;

    let data_set = Rc::new(vec![
        (start_date.timestamp_millis(), 1.0, None),
        (
            start_date.add(Duration::days(1)).timestamp_millis(),
            4.0,
            None,
        ),
        (
            start_date.add(Duration::days(2)).timestamp_millis(),
            3.0,
            None,
        ),
        (
            start_date.add(Duration::days(3)).timestamp_millis(),
            2.0,
            None,
        ),
        (
            start_date.add(Duration::days(4)).timestamp_millis(),
            5.0,
            Some(circle_text_labeller),
        ),
    ]);

    let h_scale = Rc::new(TimeScale::new(timespan, Duration::days(1))) as Rc<dyn Scale<Scalar = _>>;
    let v_scale = Rc::new(LinearScale::new(0.0..5.0, 1.0)) as Rc<dyn Scale<Scalar = _>>;

    let tooltip = Rc::from(series::y_tooltip()) as Rc<dyn Tooltipper<_, _>>;

    html! {
            <svg class="chart" viewBox={format!("0 0 {} {}", WIDTH, HEIGHT)} preserveAspectRatio="none">
                <Series<i64, f32>
                    series_type={Type::Line}
                    name="some-series"
                    data={data_set}
                    horizontal_scale={h_scale.clone()}
                    horizontal_scale_step={Duration::days(2).num_milliseconds()}
                    tooltipper={tooltip.clone()}
                    vertical_scale={v_scale.clone()}
                    x={MARGIN} y={MARGIN} width={WIDTH - (MARGIN * 2.0)} height={HEIGHT - (MARGIN * 2.0)} />

                <Axis<f32>
                    name="some-y-axis"
                    orientation={Orientation::Left}
                    scale={v_scale}
                    x1={MARGIN} y1={MARGIN} xy2={HEIGHT - MARGIN}
                    tick_len={TICK_LENGTH}
                    title={"Some Y thing"} />

                <Axis<i64>
                    name="some-x-axis"
                    orientation={Orientation::Bottom}
                    scale={h_scale}
                    x1={MARGIN} y1={HEIGHT - MARGIN} xy2={WIDTH - MARGIN}
                    tick_len={TICK_LENGTH}
                    title={"Some X thing"} />

            </svg>
    }
}
```

### Bar Chart

Using the same Yew view method code as above, `series_type` within the `Series` tag can be edited to display a bar chart instead by using the `Bar` keys.

```rust
<Series series_type={Type::Bar(BarType::Rise)} ... />
```

<p align="center"><img src="./images/bartype_rise.png" alt="A rising bar chart" width="70%" /></p>

The bar chart can also be made to 'drop' instead of 'rise' with the enum variant `BarType`. This is particularly helpful if using negative axis values, where the bars are dropping from `y = 0` or similar. 

When the `BarType` is set to `Drop`, the same data from above produces the following graph.

As seen, the bars are set to go from the selected side _to_ the datapoint. Since the axis range is from `0.0` to `5.0`, and the first point is at `(26-Mar, 1.0)`, the bar drops from `5.0` to `1.0`. 

```rust
<Series series_type={Type::Bar(BarType::Drop)} ... />
```

<p align="center"><img src="./images/bartype_drop.png" alt="A dropping bar chart" width="70%" /></p>

One final example of this is in using a negative scale and negative values. In the following graph, the axis ranges from `-5.0` to `0.0`, and the first point is `(01-Apr, -1.0)`.

### Scatter Plot

`examples/scatter` is configured to output a basic scatter plot. The method by which this is accomplished is slightly different to that of the `Line` and `Bar` charts.
